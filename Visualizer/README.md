# Visualizer

This is a visualizer for the project (filler) in Hive Helsinki. The project is written in C. For the purpose of the project, the game (filler) is
in the standard output, but it doesn't really look pretty. So I wanted to spruce it up a bit and dip my toe in the world of python by creating
a visualizer to go with my project using `Pygame`.
